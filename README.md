# Random Chuck Norris jokes
Show random Chuck Norris jokes and save them as favourites.

This was a job interview assignment I did in 2019.

## Assignment
- This application can fetch 10 Random Chuck Norris jokes, fetched from the [ICNDb API](http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/10).  
- When these jokes are fetched via a button they are displayed in a list.  
- In this list you can mark certain jokes as favourite.  
- The favourite jokes will appear in a favourites list with a max of 10 unique items.  
- There is an option to remove jokes from the favourites list as well.  
- The favourites list is stored, so next time you visit your favourites are present.  
- You can also toggle a timer via a button (every 5 seconds), this will add [one random joke](http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/1) to  
the favourites list until the list has 10 items.
